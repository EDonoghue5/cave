      <a href="check.html">Take your bag without checking, leaving your campsite, walking towards the cave entrance.</a>
      or
      You
      <a href="supplies.html">You check your bag for needed supplies, noticing you are missing a few items, but only one more item
        will fit in your bag.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href=vventuring.html">Venturing into the cave, you have already been caught with the decision of going right, or left.</a>

        <p>
          <a href=""> Choosing your full thermos, you now have a small supply of water.</a>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
<a href="right path.html"> Choosing the path to the right, you are caught with a tight gap, with this, you hold your supplies to your side as you begin to squeeze through.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="left path.html">Choosing the left path, you are met with a wide gap with jointed and jagged sides and ceilings. 
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="right path2.html">After squeezing through the tight gap, you turn to notice your bag has ripped open, leaving a box of matches behind and a box of plastic lunch bags.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="Left path2.html">Stepping slowly through the jagged cave tunnel, you fall and scratch your ankles, causing you to bleed and using some of your supply.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="closed.html"> Continuing down the right path, you hear something collide. As you turn you notice the small gap has closed you in.</a>
    </p>
    <h2>
    <p>
      <a href="eyes.html"> Continuing down the left path, you hear a few flaps of bat wings flutter by your head. Looking down you notice a pair of eyes gleaming towards you.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="scared.html"> Scared, you shimmy down the right path, slowly drinking your water in fear as you deplete your supplies.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="Raccoon.html"> Grabbing your flashlight, you shine it in the direction of the eyes, with it only being a small raccoon. Taking out a cracker from your bag you throw it towards the small animal, greeting it with hospitality.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="water.html"> Now out of water, you shutter with realization as you clench the bottle and crumple it in agitation. But you suddenly hear the sound of flowing water.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="Pal.html"> The raccoon examines you as it gets closer, it climbs up your leg and onto your shoulder as a new pal has been obtained for your adventure.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="snarl.html"> Waking it towards the water, you notice it has accumilated into a small pond. Going to scoop water from the source you hear a snarl.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="sulfur.html">You and the raccoon continue down the path, a small of fertalizer hits your nose as you notice a collection of sulfur in the side of the wall. A pickaxe and a hat is laid on the ground beneath it.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="hairless.html"> Looking over the other side of the pond, you notice a hairless figure hunched over staring at you. It snarls again as it snatches a fish from the pond and devours its head.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="bubbling.html"> You grab the pickaxe and put it to your side, the hat is left behind. Continuing down the cave you hear bubbling as the enclosed space gets warmer.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="yikes.html">The hairless figure jumps at you, scratching out your legs, leaving wounds along your ankles. It begins to bash you head, leaving you a blodied bodied on the ground. 
      Game over. </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="bath.html"> You reach the noise as you notice an underground hot spring. You take your boot off and dip your toe in to test the temperature. You leep in with your raccoon pal as you bathe your scarred body.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href=""> You look around your surroundings, noticing old camp sites with food and other supplies. You decide to stay for a few days before venturing out with your new pet.</a>
