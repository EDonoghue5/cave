  <h2>
    <p>
      You
      <a href="check.html">Take your bag without checking, leaving your campsite, walking towards the cave entrance.</a>
      or
      You
      <a href="supplies.html">You check your bag for needed supplies, noticing you are missing a few items, but only one more item
        will fit in your bag.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href=vventuring.html">Venturing into the cave, you have already been caught with the decision of going right, or left.</a>

        <p>
          <a href=""> Choosing your full thermos, you now have a small supply of water.</a>
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
<a href="right path.html"> Choosing the path to the right, you are caught with a tight gap, with this, you hold your supplies to your side as you begin to squeeze through.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    <a href="left path.html">Choosing the left path, you are met with a wide gap with jointed and jagged sides and ceilings. 
    </p>
    <p>
     <a href="right path2.html">After squeezing through the tight gap, you turn to notice your bag has ripped open, leaving a box of matches behind and a box of plastic lunch bags.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="Left path2.html">Stepping slowly through the jagged cave tunnel, you fall and scratch your ankles, causing you to bleed and using some of your supply.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="closed.html"> Continuing down the right path, you hear something collide. As you turn you notice the small gap has closed you in.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="eyes.html"> Continuing down the left path, you hear a few flaps of bat wings flutter by your head. Looking down you notice a pair of eyes gleaming towards you.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href=""> Scared, you shimmy down the right path, slowly drinking your water in fear as you deplete your supplies.</a>
